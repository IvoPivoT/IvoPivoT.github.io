<h2>Commentary</h2>
My computer is very new, it was bought a week before schoolstart. My former computer was old, and had terrible battery performance, which led to bying a new one.
This means I have little experience with this computer, and can't tell much about performance. I have not tried games on it, but opening many tabs in Google, has not been a problem.
